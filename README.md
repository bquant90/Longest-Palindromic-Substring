# Longest-Palindromic-Substring
The program calculates the longest palindromic substring using two different algorithms, "expand around center" and Manacher's Algorithm.
The user can input their own word to determine the longest palindromic substring, which will use the "expand around center" algorithm to calculate it.
The program's defined word, caba, will use Manacher's Algorithm instead. But Manacher's will also work with a user input (uncomment line 106 to try!).
